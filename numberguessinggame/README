# Number Guessing Game

This is a simple Java console game where the program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the user has to guess it. The program provides hints to help the user guess the correct number.

## How It Works
1. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100.
2. The user is prompted to enter a guess.
3. If the guess is incorrect, the program gives a hint:
   - "Too low!" if the guess is less than the selected number.
   - "Too high!" if the guess is more than the selected number.
4. The user continues guessing until they enter the correct number, at which point the program congratulates them.

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have Java installed. You can check this by running `java -version` in your command line.
2. Compile the program with:
   ```bash
   javac GuessTheNumber.java
