Features Basic arithmetic operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division Handles user input and provides appropriate error handling Provides an option for the user to exit or continue after performing an operation Uses exception handling to manage division by zero and invalid inputs Concepts Used Data Types: The project uses various data types like int, double, String for arithmetic operations and user input. Input/Output: User inputs are received via Scanner, and outputs are displayed on the console. Exception Handling: Handles invalid input and division by zero using try-catch blocks. Control Structures: Utilizes if, else, switch, and loops for program flow and decision-making. Abstraction: Abstracts the implementation of operations into methods. Encapsulation: Calculator class encapsulates methods for operations and maintains the logic. Methods: Defines methods for arithmetic operations to keep code clean and organized. Classes and Objects: The main calculator operations are modeled in a Calculator class. Requirements Java 8 or later IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) or a command-line terminal
