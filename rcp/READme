# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game in Java

This is a simple implementation of the classic **Rock-Paper-Scissors** game using the Java programming language. The game allows the user to play against the computer, which randomly selects between "Rock", "Paper", and "Scissors".

## Features
- User can choose between "Rock", "Paper", and "Scissors".
- The computer randomly selects an option.
- The game determines the winner based on the traditional rules:
  - Rock beats Scissors
  - Scissors beat Paper
  - Paper beats Rock
- Provides a tie scenario if both user and computer make the same choice.
- Handles invalid inputs gracefully.

## How to Run
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your favorite IDE (like Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or VS Code) or compile using the terminal.
3. Run the `Main.java` file.

### Running from Terminal
```bash
javac Main.java
java Main
```

## User Instructions
1. The game will prompt you to select one of the following options:
   - **R** for Rock
   - **P** for Paper
   - **S** for Scissors
2. Enter your choice (R, P, or S).
3. The program will then display the computer’s choice and announce the result (Win, Lose, or Tie).

## Example Output

Enter your choice: R
Computers choice: S
Your choice: R
You win! Rock beats Scissors.

##Code Explanation
The game logic is implemented using a `switch` statement to check the user's choice against the computer's random selection. The program uses the `Random` class to generate a random choice for the computer and the `Scanner` class to read user input.

## Technologies Used
- Java
- Random class for generating random choices
- Scanner class for user input

## Improvements
Potential improvements for future versions:
- Add a score counter to track wins, losses, and ties over multiple rounds.
- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for a better user experience.
- Add more features like best-of-three matches.
